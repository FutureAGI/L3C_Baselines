# Generating the synthetic data for general-purpose in-context learning
This directory contains the code for generating synthetic data for training and evaluation in L3C environments. For details please use the --help command.

Basically, you can generate synthetic data as follows:
- generate tasks use `gen_xxx_task.py` scripts.
- generate trajectories by using `gen_xxx_record.py` script through sampling task from the task file. The generated trajectories will be generated by built-in expert policy or user-defined policy.

or else, you may directly use `gen_xxx_record.py` to generate synthetic data without specifying the task_file (By setting `--TASK_SOURCE=NEW` instead of `--TASK_SOURCE=FILE`). In this case, the script will generate tasks randomly for each trajectory.
